## Project Introduction<br>

### Problem Statement
We get lots of visiting card from retail people, sales people, tech conferences, restaurants and hospitals etc. we store the physical ones for some time and then lose and it becomes unmanageable also. we can’t carry all of them with us always to use it. What if there is one platform which will manage the visiting cards on behalf of us and will be always available online. There will be no need to keep the hard copy and also visiting card information will be secure. This application will save the images and details of the visiting cards on cloud and will be available always once uploaded through this application.

### Project Solution
This will be a 3-tier web application using AWS resources for managing the visiting cards. We can upload the visiting card image with this app whenever we get them. It will get stored in the AWS S3 & AWS RDS with all details - name, designation, phone and email. So, it can be anyone’s personal contact list for different business services. Application user will also be able to rate the people’ services and put some comments as well based on their service for future reference and suggesting the contacts to friends. Amazon Lex will be used to receive the voice input and the required output will be given by Amazon Polly to the end users. Also, two people can share their contact list as well.
